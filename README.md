# ToDoList


# Purpose and Description
Agendas have always been an integral part of my education. Ever since Elementary School, it was introduced to me as a tool that would serve as a memory aid and guide for success. I didn't learn about the true value of agendas until my later years in Highschool, when tasks started piling up and my memory held me back from succeeding. Soon enough, using an agenda become natural to me and I continued using agendas ever since.

Some shortcomings of physical agenda's that I've come across is that an agenda may be hard to access when one is not able to sit down to write a task down. For example, when running in between classes or commuting to and from school. To overcome this shortcoming and to also challenge my abilities in Computer Programming, I have decided to create a mobile application that can serve the same function of a physical agenda and more. I have created a To-Do-List application to monitor tasks, both completed or incomplete.

# Decisions
Having low exposure with the creation of Mobile Applications, I decided to use Android Studio because I own a Android device. I also decided to use Java instead of Kotlin because I wanted to improve my object-oriented programming skills.
